- Fall logic:

initialize velocity as v = 0
           acceleration by gravity as g = 9.81 m/s^2
                                           ^ would need to convert this into PPS (pixels per second)
           max velocity as v_max = 10 (for now)
           position of the bird as y = centre of the screen 

process(clk) <- step would probs need to be con-current
    on next Clk cycle if v < v_max
        v = v + g <= updating velocity 
        y = y + v <= updating position 
              ^ (adding makes it go down)
    end if
end process

- On click fly logic:

initialize a signal C as standard logic 1 <- not clicked 
                    assuming acitve low ^
           a signal Fv as signed integer -3 <- flying velocity as 
 
process(clk) <- this one might need to be sequential
    on next Clk cycle and if signal C = '0'
        v = v + Fv <- this makes the bird shoot up
        after this gravity/ falling logic takes over
    elsif 
        falling logic persists
    end if
end process
